### Quick Start

1. **Filter** in the sidebar  
   Choose a data source (if provided), a minimum record threshold, and a **year range**.
2. **Overview**  
   Headline metrics + top servers (based on either summary totals or current range totals).
3. **Source Explorer**  
   Inspect a single server, view its yearly trend, and **download** the per-server CSV.
4. **Compare**  
   Select 2–10 servers; switch between **line** (absolute) or **stacked share** (% of total).
5. **Data**  
   Export the original wide tables and the cleaned long-format table for your reuse.

#### Tips
- Use the “Suggestions order” = **By total in selected range** to surface the most active servers for the chosen years.
- Switch the Overview ranking basis between **summary totals (all-time)** and **year-range totals** to explore different perspectives.
