### Project Overview

This dashboard tracks **preprint activity across servers** using harmonized metadata from **Crossref**, **DataCite**, and **OpenAlex**.  
It supports researchers, librarians, and research evaluators in understanding **where preprints are growing**, how activity varies by **server**, and how trends evolve **over time**.

#### Data coverage
- Providers: Crossref, DataCite, OpenAlex
- Columns include: `server_name`, `year`, `count`, `n_records`, `n_unique`, `n_is_version_of`, `n_published`, `pct_published`, `collection_date`, etc.
- Notes: Counts are derived from a normalized, long-format table. Summary-level metrics may include deduplication and linking steps (see Methods).

#### Why this matters
- Preprints are a critical part of modern scholarly communication.
- Understanding server-level activity helps with **policy**, **repository strategy**, **metadata quality**, and **research workflows**.
- The dashboard makes exploration **transparent**, **reproducible**, and **exportable**.
